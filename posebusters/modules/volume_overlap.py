    Args:
        mol_pred: Predicted molecule (docked ligand) with one conformer.
        mol_cond: Conditioning molecule (protein) with one conformer.
        clash_cutoff: Threshold for how much volume overlap is allowed. This is the maximum share of volume of
            `mol_pred` allowed to overlap with `mol_cond`. Defaults to 0.05.
        vdw_scale: Scaling factor for the van der Waals radii which define the volume around each atom. Defaults to 0.8.
        ignore_types: Which types of atoms in mol_cond to ignore. Possible values to include are "hydrogens", "protein",
            "organic_cofactors", "inorganic_cofactors", "waters". Defaults to {"hydrogens"}.
